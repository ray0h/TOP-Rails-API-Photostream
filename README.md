# The Odin Project External API App Build

[project link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/using-an-api)

This project builds a simple photostream viewer using the Flickr API.  

Two options for storing API key/secret tokens presented were the `figaro` gem or creating your own environmental variable file.  This project went with the latter.  

The interface is simple - enter a Flickr user ID and the app will pull and show public photos from their photostream.
